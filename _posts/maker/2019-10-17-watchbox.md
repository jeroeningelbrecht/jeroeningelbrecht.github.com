# The 'Watch Box' project
My first project..
A bit excited.

## Why?
Currently, I have three watches.  
Why? Because I like a new watch now and then apparently :blush:

## How
### Hinges
I was going through some instructions on [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) till I came across the term 'living hinge'.  
An example of such a living hinge can be found at [epiloglaser.nl](https://www.epiloglaser.nl/middelen/sample-club/living-hinge-lasersnijden.htm).  
You cut your material in such a way that the material itself is 'weak' enough to bend but not to break.

But, apparently, even though it looks nice, it breaks quite easily as well.  So.. normal hinge it is?  Better safe than sorry maybe..
Kudos to Licia.

Currently, I’m interested in the appraoch of [liquidhandwash](https://www.instructables.com/member/liquidhandwash/) in the [128 laser cut boxes design](https://www.instructables.com/id/128-laser-cut-boxes)
I like the fact that you don’t have this super obvious hinge at the back ( [example of such a hinge](https://www.instructables.com/id/Laser-Cut-Jewelry-Boxes-customizable-lids/) )

# Sturdy bottom of the box
[Da3da1u5](https://www.instructables.com/member/Da3da1u5/) describes in his [Laser Cut Box post on instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Laser-Cut-Box/) how one can create a more sturdy bottom that can carry more weight.

I was not able to import the PDF/AI file in my inkscape application (because I'm using Linux?) so I used the Bezier tool to draw a path alongside the original lines.

This is what it looks like right now
<div style="background-color: white;">
  <img alt="jingelski logo" src="/assets/images/watch_box.svg" />
</div>

# Box division [SOLVED]
I almost forgot but of course, having a box to put something in to keep it safe that's one thing but the stuff inside the box is not supposed to damage the rest of the contents as well.  
Hence the necessity of intersections in the box.

S**t.. this is blocking me.  I dont want to have glue smudges at the bottom of the box.  
One way to 'solve' this would be to have one big box and several smaller containers (read: boxes) inside.  

Cardinality watch - container would be: 1 - 1.


Ugh...  
Taking a look at the current (rather simple) design again, it'd make sense to provide holes in both the front and the back of the box.  When everything is put in place, you wouldn't need to glue the divisions to the bottom as they're already fixated between front and back.  
So.. [SOLVED]


# Magnets in the lid
A nice to have for now.  I don't think it's feasible to integrate magnets in the small border of the planks..  
Sticky magnets?

### Logo
The logo needs to be there.
I want to put it at the bottom of the box.

Issue is: there is no [logo]({% post_url 2019-10-15-logo %}) yet
