# The 'Watch Box' project
My first project..
A bit excited.

## Why?
Currently, I have three watches.  
Why? Because I like a new watch now and then apparently

## How
### Hinges
I was going through some instructions on [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) till I came across the term 'living hinge'.  
An example of such a living hinge can be found at [epiloglaser.nl](https://www.epiloglaser.nl/middelen/sample-club/living-hinge-lasersnijden.htm).  
You cut your material in such a way that the material itself is 'weak' enough to bend but not to break.

### Logo
The logo needs to be there:

For now, I want to put it at the bottom of the box.
