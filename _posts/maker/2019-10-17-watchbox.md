# The 'Watch Box' project
My first project..
A bit excited.

## Why?
Currently, I have three watches.  
Why? Because I like a new watch now and then apparently :blush:

## How
### Hinges
I was going through some instructions on [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) till I came across the term 'living hinge'.  
An example of such a living hinge can be found at [epiloglaser.nl](https://www.epiloglaser.nl/middelen/sample-club/living-hinge-lasersnijden.htm).  
You cut your material in such a way that the material itself is 'weak' enough to bend but not to break.

But, apparently, even though it looks nice, it breaks quite easily as well.  So.. normal hinge it is?  Better safe than sorry maybe..
Kudos to Licia.

Currently, I’m interested in the appraoch of [liquidhandwash](https://www.instructables.com/member/liquidhandwash/) in the [128 laser cut boxes design](https://www.instructables.com/id/128-laser-cut-boxes)
I like the fact that you don’t have this super obvious hinge at the back ( [example of such a hinge](https://www.instructables.com/id/Laser-Cut-Jewelry-Boxes-customizable-lids/) )

# Sturdy bottom of the box
[Da3da1u5](https://www.instructables.com/member/Da3da1u5/) describes in his [Laser Cut Box post on instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Laser-Cut-Box/) how one can create a more sturdy bottom that can carry more weight.

I was not able to import the PDF/AI file in my inkscape application (because I'm using Linux?) so I used the Bezier tool to draw a path alongside the original lines.

This is what it looks like right now
<div style="background-color: white;">
  <img alt="jingelski logo" src="/assets/images/watch_box.svg" />
</div>

### Logo
The logo needs to be there.
I want to put it at the bottom of the box.

Issue is: there is no [logo]({% post_url 2019-10-15-logo %}) yet
