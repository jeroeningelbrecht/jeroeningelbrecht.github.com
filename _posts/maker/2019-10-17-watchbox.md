# The 'Watch Box' project
My first project..
A bit excited.

## Why?
Currently, I have three watches.  
Why? Because I like a new watch now and then apparently :blush:

## How
### Hinges
I was going through some instructions on [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) till I came across the term 'living hinge'.  
An example of such a living hinge can be found at [epiloglaser.nl](https://www.epiloglaser.nl/middelen/sample-club/living-hinge-lasersnijden.htm).  
You cut your material in such a way that the material itself is 'weak' enough to bend but not to break.

But, apparently, even though it looks nice, it breaks quite easily as well.  So.. normal hinge it is?  Better safe than sorry maybe..

### Logo
The logo needs to be there.
I want to put it at the bottom of the box.

Issue is: there's no log yet ({% post_url 2019-10-15-logo %})
