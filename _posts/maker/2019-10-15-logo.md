## Text
The font should be the same as which they use for the 2019's series 'The Planets.'  
According to [fontsinuse](https://fontsinuse.com/uses/27029/the-planets-bbc-2019) BBC uses three fonts:
* Gill Sans
* Reith Sans
* Gotham

The text itself should be: jingelski

## Image/icon
The image itself should refer to space.  
Maybe a rocket..  Why not.
