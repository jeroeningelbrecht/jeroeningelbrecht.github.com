## Text
The font should be the same as which they use for the 2019's series 'The Planets.'  
According to [fontsinuse](https://fontsinuse.com/uses/27029/the-planets-bbc-2019) BBC uses three fonts:
* Gill Sans
* Reith Sans
* Gotham

The text itself should be: jingelski

A free variant to the Gotham font is: [Nexa](https://www.fontfabric.com/fonts/nexa/)

## Image/icon
The image itself should refer to space.  
Maybe a rocket..  Why not.

The idea is to turn the 'g' of 'jingelski' into a Saturnish kinda planet cfr. ![this image](https://www.codester.com/static//uploads/items/15566/preview-xl.jpg)
