# String
## String interning
Comparable to Java, and according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning):
>  string interning is a method of storing only one copy of each distinct string value ... The distinct values are stored in a string intern pool

```python
s1 = 'hello world'
s2 = 'hello world'
# are both variables s1 and s2 pointing to the same string object?
print(s1 is s2) #True
```
